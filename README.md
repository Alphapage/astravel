A tiny and fast [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree)-compliant AST walker and modifier.

Key features:

- Works on [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree)-compliant ASTs such as the ones produced by [Acorn](https://github.com/marijnh/acorn).
- Runs both in a browser and in [Node](http://nodejs.org).
- Out-of-the-box functions such as source code comments insertion.
- No dependencies and small footprint.



## Installation

The easiest way is to install it with the [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astravel):

```bash
npm install astravel
```

Alternatively, checkout this repository and install the development dependencies to build the module file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidbonnet/astravel.git
cd astravel
npm install
```

The path to the module file is `dist/astravel.min.js` and can be linked to from an HTML webpage. When used in a browser environment, the module exposes a global variable `astravel`:

```html
<script src="astravel.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```



## Usage

The `astravel` module consists of the following items described hereafter.


#### astravel.defaultTraveller

This object contains the following methods:

- `go(node, state)`: Travels through the provided `node` with a given `state` (an object that can be of any type) by recursively calling this method.
- `find(node, state)`: Travels through the provided AST `node` with a given `state`. If it catches a `Found` instance, returns it. Otherwise, returns nothing.
- `[NodeType](node, state)`: Method handler for a specific `NodeType`.
- `makeCustom(properties)`: Returns a traveller that inherits from the `defaultTraveller` with its own provided `properties` and the property `super` that points to the parent traveller object.


#### astravel.makeCustomTraveller(properties) ➞ traveller

This function returns a traveller that inherits from the `defaultTraveller` with its own provided `properties`. These properties should redefine the traveller's behavior by defining the `go(node, state)` method and/or any node handler.

When redefining the `go` method, make sure its basic functionality is kept, which consists of calling the corresponding node handler:

```javascript
var customTraveler = astravel.makeCustomTraveller({
   go: function(node, state) {
      // Code before entering the node
      console.log('Entering ' + node.type);
      // Make sure to call the parent's `go` method to keep traveling through the AST
      this.super.go(node, state);
      // Code after leaving the node
      console.log('Leaving ' + node.type);
   }
});
```

To skip specific node types, the most effective way is to replace the corresponding node handlers with a function that does nothing:

```javascript
var ignore = Function.prototype;
var customTraveller = astravel.makeCustomTraveller({
   FunctionDeclaration: ignore,
   FunctionExpression: ignore
});
```


#### astravel.Found(node, state)

When looking for a specific item, once you found it, you might want to end the traveller's journey immediately and not have him go through the rest of the entire AST. The most effective way is to throw an exception with an instance of `Found`.

```javascript
var customTraveller = astravel.makeCustomTraveller({
   FunctionDeclaration: function(node, state) {
      // Found first function declaration
      throw new astravel.Found(node, state);
   }
});
// Get the first function declaration, if any
var found = customTraveller.find(node);
if (found) console.log('Found function named ' + node.id.name)
```


#### astravel.attachComments(ast, comments) ➞ ast

This function attaches a list of `comments` to the corresponding nodes of a provided `ast` and returns that same `ast`. The `ast` is modified in-place and only the nodes getting comments are augmented with a `comments` and/or a `trailingComments` array property.

Each comment should be an object with the following properties:

- `type`: `"Line"` or `"Block"`
- `value`: Comment string value
- `start`: Comment starting character offset number
- `end`: Comment ending character offset number
- `loc`: Location object with `start` and `end` properties containing one-based `line` number and zero-based `column` number properties.

This example shows how to obtain a proper list of `comments` of a given source `code` with [Acorn](https://github.com/marijnh/acorn) and how to attach them on the generated `ast`:

```javascript
var comments = [];
var ast = acorn.parse(code, {
   // This ensures that the `loc` property is present on comment objects
   locations: true,
   // Acorn will store the comment objects in this array
   onComment: comments
});
// Attach comments on the ast
astravel.attachComments(ast, comments);
```

The algorithm assumes that comments are not put in exotic places, such as in-between function arguments, and proceeds as follows:

- For a given statement, it attaches all comments right above it and on it's right side.
- If a comment block is at the beginning of a code block, it is attached to that code block.
- Comments not followed by any statement in a code block are attached as `trailingComments` to that code block.

In this example, the comments tell to which statement they are attached:

```javascript
// Attached to the variable declaration just below
var point = {
   // This comment is attached to the property definition just below
   x: 0,
   y: 0 // This comment is attached to the property definition on its left
};
/*
This comment block is attached to the function declaration just below.
*/
function add(a, b) {
   /*
   This secondary comment block is attached to the function body.
   */
   return a + b; // This comment is attached to the return statement on its left
   // This trailing comment is attached as such to the function body
}
// This trailing comment is attached as such to the program body
```



## Building

All building scripts are defined in the `package.json` file and rely on the [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/). All commands must be run from within the root repository folder.

### Production

The source code of Astravel is written in JavaScript 6 and located at `src/astravel.js`. It is compiled down to a minified JavaScript 5 file located at `dist/astravel.min.js` using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) and [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2). This is achieved by running:
```bash
npm install
```

If you are already using a JavaScript 6 to 5 compiler for your project, or a JavaScript 6 compliant interpreter, you can include the `src/astravel.js` file directly.

A non-minified and source map free version can be obtained at `dist/astravel.js` by running:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Development

If you are working on Astravel, you can use [Watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify) to build automatically at each modification a non-minified version (along with a source map for easy debugging) located at `dist/astravel.debug.js` by running:
```bash
npm start
```

While making changes to Astravel, make sure it passes the tests by running:
```bash
npm test
```
